## The Traditional Route: Furniture Insurance (The Reactive Safety Net)

Furniture insurance is typically an add-on to a homeowner’s or renter’s policy. It acts as a **financial backup for major, catastrophic incidents** — and it is fundamentally **reactive**, not preventive.

### **The Claims Process**

1. Damage occurs  
2. You file a formal claim  
3. You pay a deductible (often $500–$1,000+)  
4. An adjuster inspects the damage  
5. You wait for approval  
6. You receive a payout — *minus your deductible*

### **The Critical Fine Print**

Traditional insurance is built for disasters like fire, theft, flooding, or a fallen tree.  
What it **does not** cover are the everyday issues that happen constantly:

- Pet scratches  
- Minor stains  
- Sun fading  
- Water rings  
- Dings, dents, or wobbly legs  
- Wear and tear from regular use  

These exclusions often make insurance feel unhelpful for real-life furniture needs.

2. You schedule a repair online in a few clicks  
3. A certified technician arrives with all necessary equipment  
4. The repair is done professionally and efficiently  
5. You pay **$0 extra** — it’s included in your membership
