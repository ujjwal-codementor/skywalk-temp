## Introduction: Protect Before It’s Too Late

Traditional furniture insurance may offer peace of mind against accidents — but it fails to protect against the everyday wear that truly erodes your investment. Scratches, fading, and gradual aging aren’t covered.  
And by the time visible damage appears, restoration becomes expensive.

**FurnishCare** bridges this gap with a subscription-based service focused on **prevention over reaction**.  
It’s not just coverage — it’s a *philosophy of care*.

## Understanding the Limits of Traditional Insurance

Insurance plays a role in protecting against rare accidents, but it is fundamentally **reactive**.

Most policies exclude:

- Daily wear, stains, and fading  
- Routine touch-ups or preventive adjustments  
- Immediate service without lengthy claims  
- Simple cosmetic fixes or aging-related issues  

Luxury homeowners expect more than coverage — they expect **continuity of care**.  
That’s exactly where FurnishCare excels.

## Subscription Care: A Proactive Model for Modern Homes

FurnishCare offers quarterly or semi-annual visits from expert technicians who maintain, clean, and restore every detail of your furniture.

### What subscription care looks like:

- Preventive polishing & leather conditioning  
- Structural tightening and realignment  
- Early detection of wear and deterioration  
- Fabric & wood revitalization  
- Scheduled deep cleaning for long-term health  

The result?  
**Longevity, elegance, and performance** — maintained through quiet consistency rather than crisis repair.
