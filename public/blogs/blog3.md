## Introduction: When Insurance Isn’t Enough  

Owning fine furniture is more than a matter of style — it's an investment in craftsmanship, heritage, and comfort. Yet many homeowners assume insurance will protect these prized pieces, only to discover its limitations after the fact. Deductibles, exclusions, and delayed claims often leave valuable furniture vulnerable.

**FurnishCare** offers a more intelligent approach. Designed as a luxury alternative to traditional insurance, it delivers proactive maintenance, expert restoration, and exclusive membership benefits — ensuring every piece remains as exquisite as the day it arrived.
